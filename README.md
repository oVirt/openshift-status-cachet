## I'm looking to contribute to this awesome project!

Sweet, we're always looking for contributions that improve Cachet! It's easy to get started and you don't even need to know how to write a single line of code!

### Contributing as a non-developer/non-designer

We're always looking for new [translations](#translations).

Of course bug reports, feature requests and [documentation](https://docs.cachethq.io) are always appreciated.

### Contributing as a designer

As Cachet gains new features, the design and ideas that were once a perfect fit need updating and in some cases designing from scratch. This is where you come in! Fancy giving Cachet a lick of paint? Sweet!

You'll need to install Node.js, Bower and Gulp.

To get started you can do the following:

1. Install Node.js and our dev dependencies.
2. Make your changes to the SCSS files in `./resources/assets/sass/`
3. Run `gulp`

If you're making a lot of changes, you'll find that running `gulp watch` will make life easier for you!

### Contributing as a developer

Built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

We use these extra dependencies to develop Cachet:

- Node.js
- Gulp
- Git

Once cloned to your local machine, you'll need some demo data! Run `php artisan cachet:seed` to get the demo installation ready for action.

## Installation, Upgrades and Documentation

Documentation is found at [https://docs.cachethq.io](https://docs.cachethq.io).

Here are some useful quick links:

To test out the demo, you may login to the [Dashboard](https://demo.cachethq.io/dashboard) with the following:

- **Username:** `test` or `test@test.com`
- **Password:** `test123`

The demo is reset every half hour.

We list releases on the [Releases page](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/releases) of the [Cachet GitHub repository](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet). On the Releases page, you can also find the release notes for each release.
